Don't hide, no need to hide, The fishes in the mask you wear, Concealing your true side. They said go, said go and tame every monster with your light, They said go fight every single fight, like this is your last fight. Not every hero wears a golden crown, or hears the sound of glory from the crowd, Who said heroes can't be found here on the ground? Love how you stand on your own, won't bow down to anyone, Love how you keep fighting on when all hope is gone, Love how you refuse to cry, block your fate out for a night, Whistle similar, you and I both refuse to die. Go now, should I, wear in these radicals, Go down, fly, survive, to keep my dream alive, For the biggest and the valiant beat my foes, Who said heroes can't be ordinary souls? They said go, the seeds of your demise now have already been sown, Before you know, your head is hanging low, your friends land up in a row, No matter how much rain or winds may blow, still we will make us stand here all alone, Who said ordinary players aren't heroes? Love how you stand on your own, won't bow down to anyone, Love how you keep fighting on when all hope is gone, Love how you refuse to cry, block your fate out for a night, Whistle similar, you and I both refuse to die.

Love how you stand on your own, won't bow down to anyone, Love how you keep fighting on when all hope is gone, Love the glory's all your own, step into the danger zone, You can build the world you want on top of ruined stones, Go now, go now, to keep my dream alive, I'll fly, survive, give everything my life, For the biggest and the valiant beat my foes, Who said heroes can't be ordinary souls?\n",
