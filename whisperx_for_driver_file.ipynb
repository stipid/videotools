            "Transcript: [0.672 --> 28.28]  Halloween. About an hour before we were supposed to start trick or treating, I still didn't have a costume. At that point, I was seriously thinking about going as a cowboy for the second year in a row. But then mom knocked at my door and handed me a pirate costume with an eye patch and a hook and everything. Rowley showed up around 6.30 wearing his night costume, but it didn't look anything like it looked yesterday.\n",
            "Transcript: [28.921 --> 57.608]  Rowley's mom made all these safety improvements to it, and you couldn't even tell what he was supposed to be anymore. She cut out a big hole in the front of the helmet so he could see better, and covered him up in all this reflective tape. She made him wear his winter coat underneath everything, and she replaced his sword with a glow stick. I grabbed my pillowcase, and me and Rowley started to head out. But mom stopped us before we could get out the door. She said, I want you to take Manny with you.\n",
            "Transcript: [59.532 --> 79.512]  Man, I should have known there was a catch when mom gave me that costume. I told mom there was no way we were taking Manny with us, because we were going to hit 152 houses in three hours. And plus, we were going to be on Snake Road, which is way too dangerous for a little kid like Manny.\n",
            "Transcript: [80.93 --> 105.145]  I should never have mentioned that last part, because the next thing I knew, mom was telling dad he had to go with us to make sure we didn't step foot outside our neighborhood. Dad tried to squirm out of it, but once mom makes up her mind, there's no way you can change it. Before we even got out of our own driveway, we ran into our neighbor, Mr. Mitchell, and his kid, Jeremy. So of course, they tagged along with us.\n",
            "Transcript: [106.242 --> 131.437]  Manny and Jeremy wouldn't trick or treat at any houses with spooky decorations on them. So that ruled out pretty much every house on our block. Dad and Mr. Mitchell started talking about football or something. And every time one of them wanted to make a point, they'd stop walking. So we were hitting only about one house every 20 minutes. After a couple of hours, Dad and Mr. Mitchell took the little kids home.\n",
            "Transcript: [132.044 --> 160.867]  I was glad because that meant me and Rowley could take off. My pillowcase was almost empty, so I wanted to make up as much time as possible. A little while later, Rowley told me he needed a potty break. I made him hold off for another 45 minutes. But by the time we got to my grandma's house, it was pretty clear that if I didn't let Rowley use the bathroom, it was gonna get messy. So I told Rowley if he wasn't back outside in one minute, I was gonna start helping myself to his candy.\n",
            "Transcript: [162.723 --> 187.09]  After that, we headed back out on the road. But it was already 10.30, and I guess that's when most grownups decide Halloween is over. You can kind of tell, because that's when they start coming to the door in their pajamas and giving you the evil eye. We decided to head home. We made up a lot of time after Dad and Manny left, so I was pretty satisfied with how much candy we took in.\n",
            "Transcript: [187.968 --> 217.347]  When we were halfway home, this pickup truck came roaring down the street with a bunch of high school kids in it. The kid in the back was holding a fire extinguisher, and when the truck passed by us, he opened fire. I have to give Rowley credit, because he blocked about 95% of the water with his shield. And if he hadn't done that, all our candy would have gotten soaked. When the truck drove away, I yelled out something that I regretted about two seconds later.\n",

The only place I could think of that was safe was Grandma's house, so we cut through a couple backyards to get there. Grandma was in bed already, but I knew she keeps a key under the mat on her front porch.\n",

I tried to trick them into leaving by shouting, well, I guess now that we're safe in our own house, you can't get us. But they wouldn't budge. After a while, we realized the teenagers were going to wait us out, so we decided we were just gonna have to spend the night at grandma's. That's when we started getting cocky, making monkey noises at the teenagers and whatnot.\n",

So that meant we were gonna have to make a run for it.\n",

That's when I thanked my lucky stars the girls were on the other side of the gym. Mr. Underwood divided us up into weight groups.

I've never been all that interested in getting in shape before, but this wrestling unit has made me rethink things. I figure if I bulk up now, it could actually come in handy down the road. The football unit is coming in the spring, and they split the teams up into shirts and skins, and I always get put on skins.\n",

If I can pack on some muscle now, it'll be a whole different story next April. Tonight, after dinner, I got mom and dad together and told them my plan. I told them I was going to need some serious exercise equipment and some weight gain powder too. I showed them some muscle magazines I got at the store so they could see how ripped I was gonna be.\n",

And if I get pinned by Fregley one more time, I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown. So it looks like mom and dad aren't going to be any help.

Halloween is my favorite holiday, even though mom says I'm getting too old to go trick or treating anymore. Halloween is dad's favorite holiday too, but for a different reason. On Halloween night, while all the other parents are handing out candy, dad is hiding in the bushes with a big trash can full of water. And if any teenagers pass by our driveway, he drenches them.\n",
            "Transcript: [34.523 --> 59.093]  I'm not sure dad really understands the concept of Halloween, but I'm not gonna be the one who spoils his fun. Tonight was the opening night of the Crossland High School Haunted House, and I got mom to agree to take me and Rowley. Rowley showed up at my house wearing his Halloween costume from last year. When I called him earlier, I told him to just wear regular clothes, but of course he didn't listen.\n",
            "Transcript: [59.937 --> 82.381]  I tried not to let it bother me too much, though. I've never been allowed to go to the Crossland Haunted House before, and I wasn't going to let Rowley ruin it for me. Roderick has told me all about it, and I've been looking forward to this for about three years. Anyway, when we got to the entrance, I started having second thoughts about going in.\n",
            "Transcript: [82.651 --> 112.351]  But mom seemed like she was in a hurry to get this over with, and she moved us along. Once we were through the gate, it was one scare after another. There were vampires jumping out at you, and people without heads, and all sorts of crazy stuff. But the worst part was this area called Chainsaw Alley. There was this big guy in a hockey mask, and he had a real chainsaw. Roderick told me the chainsaw had a rubber blade, but I wasn't taking any chances.\n",
            "Transcript: [112.452 --> 141.173]  I ran. Right when it looked like the chainsaw guy was going to catch us, mom stepped in and bailed us out. She said, that's not nice. And he mumbled, I'm sorry, ma'am. Mom made the chainsaw guy show us where the exit was, and that was the end of our haunted house experience right there. I guess it was a little embarrassing when mom did that, but I'm willing to let it go this one time.\n",

            "Transcript: [1.162 --> 22.795]  Saturday, the Crossland Haunted House really got me thinking. Those guys were charging five bucks a pop, and the line stretched halfway around the school. I decided to make a haunted house of my own. Actually, I had to bring Rowley in on the deal, because mom wouldn't let me convert our first floor into a full out haunted mansion.\n",
            "Transcript: [23.217 --> 36.683]  I knew Rowley's dad wouldn't be crazy about the idea either, so we decided to build the haunted house in his basement and just not mention it to his parents. Me and Rowley spent most of the day coming up with an awesome plan for our haunted house.\n",
            "Transcript: [37.443 --> 59.853]  Here was our final plan, a hall of screams, a lake of blood, a bottomless pit, a rat tunnel, a maze of 1,000 skulls, a knife alley, a severed hand hall, and last, a death slide into an acid lake.\n",
            "Transcript: [61.844 --> 87.292]  I don't mean to brag or anything, but what we came up with was way better than the Crossland High School haunted house. We realized we were gonna need to get the word out that we were doing this thing, so we got some paper and made up a bunch of flyers. Haunted house with live sharks. I'll admit, maybe we stretched the truth a little in our advertisement, but we had to make sure people actually showed up.\n",
            "Transcript: [88.574 --> 112.874]  By the time we finished putting the flyers up around the neighborhood and got back to Rowley's basement, it was already 2.30 and we hadn't even started putting the actual haunted house together yet. So we had to cut some corners from our original plan. When three o'clock rolled around, we looked outside to see if anyone had showed up. And sure enough, there were about 20 neighborhood kids waiting in line outside Rowley's basement.\n",
            "Transcript: [113.684 --> 141.578]  Now, I know our flyer said admission was $0.50, but I could see that we had a chance to make a killing here. So I told the kids that admission was $2, and the $0.50 thing was just a typo. The first kid to cough up his $2 was Shane Snella. He paid his money, and we let him inside, and me and Rowley took our positions in the Hall of Screams. The Hall of Screams was basically a bed with me and Rowley on either side of it.\n",
            "Transcript: [142.962 --> 162.065]  I guess maybe we made the Hall of Screams a little too scary, because halfway through, Shane curled up in a ball underneath the bed. We tried to get him to crawl out from under there, but he wouldn't budge. I started thinking about all the money we were losing with this kid clogging up the Hall of Screams, and I knew we had to get him out of there quick.\n",
            "Transcript: [163.094 --> 191.528]  Eventually, Rowley's dad came downstairs. At first, I was happy to see him because I thought he could help us drag Shane out from under the bed and get our haunted house cranking again. But Rowley's dad wasn't really in a helpful mood. Rowley's dad wanted to know what we were doing and why Shane Snella was curled up under the bed. We told him that the basement was a haunted house and that Shane Snella actually paid for us to do this to him. But Rowley's dad didn't believe us.\n",
            "Transcript: [192.507 --> 217.06]  I admit that if you looked around, it didn't really look like a haunted house. All we had time to put together was the Hall of Screams and the Lake of Blood, which was just Rowley's old baby pool with half a bottle of ketchup in it. I tried to show Rowley's dad our original plan to prove that we really were running a legitimate operation, but he still didn't seem convinced. And to make a long story short, that was the end of our haunted house.\n",
            "Transcript: [218.005 --> 226.291]  The good news is, since Rowley's dad didn't believe us, he didn't make us refund Shane's money. So at least we cleared two bucks today.\n",

Anyway, I felt kind of bad for Rowley, so tonight I tried to make it up to him.\n",
            "Transcript: [29.242 --> 48.142]  I turned on one of Rowley's favorite TV shows, and I did a play-by-play over the phone so he could kind of experience it that way. I did my best to keep up with what was going on on the screen, but to be honest with you, I'm not sure if Rowley was getting the full effect. Tuesday\n",
            "Transcript: [49.627 --> 73.387]  Well, Rowley's grounding is finally over, and just in time for Halloween too. I went up to his house to check out his costume, and I have to admit, I'm a little jealous. Rowley's mom got him this knight costume that's way cooler than his costume from last year. His knight outfit came with a helmet and a shield and a real sword and everything.\n",
            "Transcript: [74.602 --> 104.2]  I've never had a store-bought costume before. I still haven't figured out what I'm gonna go as tomorrow night, so I'll probably just throw something together at the last minute. I figure maybe I'll bring back the toilet paper mummy again. But I think it's supposed to rain tomorrow night, so that might not be the smartest choice. In the past few years, the grownups in my neighborhood have been getting cranky about my lame costumes. And I'm starting to think it's actually having an effect on the amount of candy I'm bringing in.\n",
            "Transcript: [104.926 --> 118.325]  But I don't really have time to put together a good costume, because I'm in charge of planning out the best route for me and Rowley to take tomorrow night. This year, I've come up with a plan that'll get us at least twice the candy we scored last year.\n",
